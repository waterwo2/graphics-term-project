Sphere Packing - Term Project - Fred Barthel, Parker Carlson, Martin Soto, Bryan Stoffel, Megan Waterworth
-------------------------------------------
This project implements normal and dense sphere packing algorithms and views it in OpenGL.

Bryan, Parker, and Martin: Writing the Algorithm

Megan and Fred: Writing OpenGL and Animation


Getting Started
----------------
Need: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 with the C/C++ Compiler Package, OpenGL installed

Note: Our code was run using a Windows 10 machine.

Install Visual Studio Community 2017 and open the application.
Go to Tools > Get Tools and Features.
This will open the Visual Studio Installer.
Ensure that C/C++ Compiler is included. If not, download it.

To run this code, you must have OpenGL installed on your computer.


Running the Application
------------------------
To run the application, create a new empty project in Visual Studio.
Then Add New File to the Source Files area and add the Spheres.cpp file. (Located at TermProject-Final_v3 > TermProject_v3 > Spheres.cpp)

When those two things are done, you can simply click "Local Windows Debugger" on the top to run the program.

The command prompt window will prompt you for a box length, width, and height, and sphere radius.
From there, the program will render the spheres in the box in a separate visual window.
The controls once the visual is rendered are listed in the command prompt window.
