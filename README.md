Sphere Packing - Term Project - Fred Barthel, Parker Carlson, Martin Soto, Bryan Stoffel, Megan Waterworth
-------------------------------------------
This project implements normal and dense sphere packing algorithms and views it in OpenGL.


Getting Started
----------------
Need: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 with the C/C++ Compiler Package, OpenGL installed

Note: Our code was run using a Windows 10 machine.

Install Visual Studio Community 2017 and open the application.
Go to Tools > Get Tools and Features.
This will open the Visual Studio Installer.
Ensure that C/C++ Compiler is included. If not, download it.

To run this code, you must have OpenGL installed on your computer.


Running the Application
------------------------
To run the application, create a new empty project.
Then Add New File to the Source Files area and add the Spheres.cpp file.

When those two things are done, you can simply click "Local Windows Debugger" on the top to run the program.

The command prompt window will prompt you for a box length, width, and height, and sphere radius.
From there, the program will render the spheres in the box in a separate visual window.
The controls once the visual is rendered are listed in the command prompt window.
